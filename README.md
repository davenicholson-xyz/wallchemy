## ðŸŒ† Wallchemy - Random wallpaper fetcher and setter for wallhaven.cc

Wallchemy is a CLI tool written in Go for fetching random wallpapers from [wallhaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc/). Wallchemy will randomly choose a wallpaper from various lists including your own collections using your API key. Wallchemy will set the wallpaper on your desktop on Windows, Mac and many Linux desktop environments. 

### Supported desktop environments

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux
  - Gnome
  - Ubuntu
  - KDE Plasma
  - XFCE
  - Cinnamon
  - MATE
  - Budgie

Any unsupported can be manually set by passing a custom script. Feel free to raise an issue or a pull request for any missing environments.

All queries and selected wallpapers are cached to cut down on API calls.

### Installation

### Configuration 

Configuration is stored in `$HOME/.config/wallchemy/config.yml` on linux/mac or `%appdata%/Roaming/wallchemy/config.yml` on Windows. Wallchemy's defaults will be overwritten by these options, which in turn will be overwritten by any environment variables set proceeded with `wallchemy_`. These can then be overridden with any command line flags.

An example `config.yml` is in this [here](https://github.com/davenicholson-xyz/wallchemy/blob/main/examples/config.yml)

### Usage

Call the `wallchemy` command and select an option to retrieve a random wallpaper.

`wallchemy -collection name` will select a wallpaper from your collection with that name. Include your username and API key in the config/flags.

`wallchemy -random search_term` will return wallpapers from that query. 

`wallchemy -top` to get a random wallpaper from the toplist. Pass a range option to search time range `-range 1w` will search the toplist for the past week.

`wallchemy -hot` will get wallpapers from the hottest wallpapers list.

## Setting wallpaper with external script

The wallchemy app sets the wallpaper depending on OS and desktop environment used. If yours is currently unsupported or you need a custom script you can set it using the `script` option in `config.yml` or via the `-script` flag (`wallchemy -hot -script "swww img"`)

You can also just pipe the output directly into a script.

`wallchemy -top | swww img` for example. Or if it does not allow piping `feh --bg-fill $(wallchemy -top)`
